adversarial nets use gradient ascent on input rather than gradient descent on weights to try and change weights just the right way to get an wrong label


Generative Adversarial networks:  

how to change the output weights of an adversarial "generator" network to make it a better adversary. the adversary's output is added as a "delta" to the input image to a discriminator network. 

GAN: generative adversarial networks, regarded by Yann LeCunn as most important breakthrough. invented by ian goodfellow
