### Shallow 3 convolutional layer trial net

based on learning rate:  http://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-3/  
I am doing just fine with chollet's blog network

This surpasses DeepMammo's Levy net, with only 3 layers....! 

I suspect this has to do with my real-time data augmentation, which permits many different image rotation/flip combinations.
