##### B. Applying/improving existing techniques to a new dataset.
As part of a current ongoing open competition, a dataset of 640,000 de-identified digital mammography images from over 86000 patients, with corresponding clinical variables is available for training. The benefits include large dataset size, free computational resources (model is trained remotely on their server). The downsides are that the data is not publicly viewable and one is unable to access the trained model for inspection/visualization.
